# Horiseon Social Solution Services

## Description
Horiseon has an amazing website that demonstrates the results of good HTML and CSS writing. To further my learning, and to further correct their code, I consolidated and simplified their HTML and CSS files. This will make it easier for other developers to navigate and follow the flow of the code. I learned that you can use different HTML tags in the same spot while producing the same end-result. The CSS code can be combined quite a bit as well. Instead of having a line for every bit of information you want to affect, you can group them into different "id" or "class" groups and apply the changes to them all.

## Usage
Users can get to Horiseon's website by pasting their URL in the address bar. Once the page is accessed, the user can use the headers in the upper right to navigate to specific areas of the webpage. Each header leads to the correspoding section that has the same header.
